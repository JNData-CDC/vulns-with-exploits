# What?
A list of CVEs with (publicly) available exploits.

# How?
- get a list of CVEs (NVD)
- the script tries to be nice for NVD, and only downloads vulnerabilities, if no local copy is present, or modifications has been published
- for each CVE, check if there's an exploit available (vulndb)

# Requirements
- `python3`
- for the list of required packages see `requirements.txt`
- install with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Defaults
By default returns CVEs for a period of `(${today}-1y, ${today})`. The date of the vulnerability is `vuln:published-datetime` value in NVD.

# Notes
